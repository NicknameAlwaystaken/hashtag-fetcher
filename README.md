# hashtag-fetcher

The program has ability to find all #words from webpage(s)
Then you can also see the found words and filter them by size, blacklist them or transform words.
Resulting list will show on the right and you can save it.

You can also save your settings.
WARNING: Only one set of settings is read and written on, meaning if you want to use different set of settings then you have to manually do the work.
Settings file name: 'filter_settings.json'

NOTE: The program seems to be a bit slow on the launch, especially with a larger settings file.
